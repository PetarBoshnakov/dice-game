## About
---
This game is developed as a project invitation that I found on the Strypes portal. I try to provide a solution to a very hard problem where players are forced to use deception. More on the game can be found in the section [Rules of the game](#rules-of-the-game)

## Rules of the game
---
The game is played by two or more players. Five dice are used per player with dice cups used for concealment. The game is round-based. Each round, each player rolls a "hand" of dice under their cup and looks at their hand while keeping it concealed from other players. The first player begins his turn by bidding. A bid consists of announcing any face value and a number of dice. This bid is the player's claim as to how many dice with that particular value there are on the whole table. Turns rotate among the players in a clockwise order. Each player has two choices during their turn: 

> __to make a higher bid__

> __to challenge the previous bid, by calling the last bidder liar__

Raising the bid means that the player may bid a higher quantity of the same face, or any particular quantity of a higher face. If the current player challenges the previous bid, all dice are revealed. If the bid is valid (there are at least as many of the face value as were bid), the bidder wins. Otherwise, the challenger wins. The player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last player to still retain a die is the winner. The loser of the last round starts the bidding for the next round. If the loser of the last round was eliminated, the next player starts the new round.

The game has a 'wild' mode option. The rules for the wild mode are that the 1s are counted toward the players bid. Essentially every time the player is playing with twice as many options.
